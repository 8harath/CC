- [ ] Alert notification system with sound/vibration
- [ ] Incident detail display with victim information
- [ ] Response acknowledgment system
- [ ] Alert history and management

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### MQTT Configuration
```kotlin
// MQTT Broker Settings (your Mosquitto)
val brokerUrl = "tcp://192.168.1.100:1883"  // Your laptop's IP
val clientId = "android_client_${System.currentTimeMillis()}"
val username = "android_user"  // If authentication is enabled
val password = "android_pass"  // If authentication is enabled
```

### Message Schemas
```json
// Emergency Alert Message
{
  "type": "emergency_alert",
  "incidentId": "unique_incident_id",
  "victimId": "user_id",
  "victimName": "John Doe",
  "location": {
    "latitude": 40.7128,
    "longitude": -74.0060
  },
  "timestamp": 1640995200000,
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "medicalInfo": {
    "bloodType": "O+",
    "allergies": ["penicillin"],
    "medications": ["insulin"]
  }
}

// Response Message
{
  "type": "response_ack",
  "incidentId": "unique_incident_id",
  "responderId": "responder_user_id",
  "responderName": "Emergency Team",
  "status": "RESPONDING",
  "eta": 300,  // seconds
  "timestamp": 1640995200000
}
```

### Topic Structure
```
emergency/
â”œâ”€â”€ alerts/           # Emergency broadcasts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ +/           # Individual incidents
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ broadcast    # General alerts
â”œâ”€â”€ status/          # Status updates
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ +/           # Individual status
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ system       # System status
â””â”€â”€ response/        # Responder acknowledgments
    â”œâ”€â”€ +/           # Individual responses
    â””â”€â”€ broadcast    # General responses
```

## ðŸš€ Integration with Your Mosquitto Broker

### Broker Setup Verification
1. **Check Mosquitto Status**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   netstat -an | findstr 1883
   
   # Or check Mosquitto service
   sc query mosquitto
   ```

2. **Test MQTT Connection**:
   ```bash
   # Install MQTT client for testing
   mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test/topic -m "Hello MQTT"
   mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test/topic
   ```

3. **Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure Mosquitto listens on all interfaces: `0.0.0.0:1883`
   - Configure firewall to allow port 1883
   - Get your laptop's IP address for Android connection

### Android Network Configuration
```kotlin
// Get laptop's IP address (usually 192.168.x.x)
val brokerUrl = "tcp://YOUR_LAPTOP_IP:1883"

// For local testing, you can use:
val brokerUrl = "tcp://10.0.2.2:1883"  // Android emulator to localhost
val brokerUrl = "tcp://192.168.1.100:1883"  // Physical device to laptop
```
