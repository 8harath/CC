# Core Functional Interface Design
## Two-Mode MQTT Mobile Application

### Overview
This document outlines the refined core functional interface for a two-mode mobile application designed for MQTT-based communication between smartphones. The application prioritizes clarity, efficiency, and reliability while keeping additional features modular and hidden for potential future development.

### Design Principles

1. **Minimalism First**: Only essential components are visible by default
2. **Clear Mode Separation**: Distinct interfaces for Crash Victim and Emergency Responder modes
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features are hidden but accessible when needed
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time status updates and message delivery confirmation
5. **Future-Proof Architecture**: Modular design allowing iterative enhancements
